I would have been ok with it except the burrito was so puny when it arrived! Almost the same size as the little burritos youd get at a cafeteria on a school campus. 
By comparison, super cucas and daily grind are both substantialy larger burritos with better flavor. 

From a flavor standpoint it was also subpar, and i ordered a chorizo burrito and they put in some other kind of random pork cut. 

Get it together el sitio. Mexican food isn't difficult  and it shouldn't be expensive.",Neutral,Neutral

1st Time: Apparently we walked in 15 minutes prior to closing, so the lady (owner) rudely yelled at us to get out. Definitely left me a bad taste in my mouth but I kinda get it since most places need you to come in 30 mins prior to closing. Whatever.

2nd Time: We came in an hour or so prior to closing time. Lady let us sit down but blurted that we had to hurry and order....no idea why that is so since we gave them more than 30 mins of preparation time. Anyways, I ordered my usual at Vietnamese places - charboiled beef over broken rice. I don't know if it's because they were rushed to close or what, but I received the smallest portion of beef ever - literally thin slices (6 max or so) over a large bed of rice. Are you serious? And to bring back the bad taste in my mouth from my first visit, the lady rushed us once again, rudely asking us to hurry up. I barely set down my chopsticks after sifting through what was good on my plate when the lady made a beeline for my table, grabbing my plate away while curtly asking, ""You done? Done eating?"" YEAH, I AM DONE....SINCE YOU JUST GRABBED THE PLATE FROM ME.

Taste of the food is alright, not too sure about the actual pho vermicelli/noodle stuff since I'm not a fan of traditional pho cuisine. However, the stingy portions put me off and the attitude of the owner here is in dire need of a change. You won't draw in diners with that type of attitude.

Overall though, I don't get why people rave about this place. I guess since it's SB and there's no legit Asian food around, everyone goes bananas. Either that or I'm spoiled for having grown up in the 626 area. Whichever way it goes, I won't be coming back here. If you are a UCSB student, I reckon you find a time or weekend to make a day trip to LA - get some legit Asian food or pho (whatever you want) - I guarantee afterwards, you will never come back to this place!",Neutral,Neutral

LlGIlNJE2Nv_PXkH7l4Wmg,2DKEACu_uSxyg89UTrSATg,Positive,0.756589949,Space,"I love Lilly's Taqueria! It was the first Mexican place I tried after moving here. Let me begin by saying that I'm from Georgia, and ate quite a lot of good Mexican food in the rural, southern part of the state. Lilly's provided the best Mexican food I've had since leaving South Georgia ten years ago.

First of all, the tacos themselves are excellent. I've tried the more everyday meats - chicken, carne asada, etc. - but my favorite is the mejilla taco (beef cheek meat). It may sound adventurous, but it's more like very tender steak than anything. And  Lilly's does mejilla right: extremely tender and long on the flavor! (For food thrill-seekers, they also sell ojo tacos, or beef eyeballs...I'll admit I have yet to try them.)

I like the casual feel and incredible range of topping choices. The vegetables are always very fresh, and I think the salsas might be homemade. Finally, the people who work here are incredibly nice and the service is prompt, even when the line is out the door. For the best Mexican food in the area, look no further!",Positive,Neutral

One thing I love about this place too is that you always stand a good chance of seeing a celebrity. I make it a point to sit outside at one of their tables for as long as I can stand in hopes of catching a glimpse of one of the many famous people residing in the area.

Appetizer nachos: pretty good, I love the ""cheese'
Eggplant Parmesan:  FABULOUS flavor and crunch on top of a bed of saucy noodles!
Quiche:  Melts-in-your-mouth, close-your-eyes GOOD!! just try it.
Adama AFC:  Tastes like home-made mozzarella sticks and yummy mashed taters.
BEST OF ALL: Pecan pie and almond ice cream... my mouth is still watering.

It should've been renamed ""lobster salad roll"". Had to send it back and left. Was very disappointed and frankly didn't want to order something else and continue to wait.",Neutral,Neutral

Actually, I wasn't sure we'd be able to fit Lure in during our short stay here in SB, but I needed to run an errand at Macy's (whachu know about Clinique Bonus Time?  I've been down since my mom shared her little yellow moisturizers with me in the 90s).

So, off I went to the mall, coworker in tow, and as we pulled around to the Macy's side of the shopping center, lo and behold!  It's right next to Lure.  God provides, y'all.

Those beautiful oysters are every bit as delicious as they are photogenic.  The happy hour price for 1/2 dozen is $11 (Sept 2019), and you can't eat just three.  So we got a second order.  I could have kept going, but I was also filling up on the bottle of wine we ordered, a perfectly grilled artichoke, and the BEST sourdough bread I've ever had.  Honestly, between those naughty oysters, the viognier, and the magic bread, I got dangerously close to tears of joy.",Positive,Positive

We loved this place so much we decided to come back here the next day before we had back to the Bay Area. Their menu doesn't have a lot of items, but It's simple food that taste really good.

They were both great (I ordered the same thing when we came back the 2 time), my other sister had their arugula salad and she loved that. I had the avocado pizza, and that was good too and my nieces shared the farmers market pizza which changes each time, depending what they decide to get at the market that day. It was a potato pizza and they both loved it. If you come here, GET their fried chicken. It is soooooo good.

Wow, this place needs to figure things out quick to have any chance of surviving the location",Neutral,Negative

For someone as picky as I am, this place is perfect because every pizza is made however YOU want it. My favorite is the specialty chipotle chicken pizza but when I need something a bit lighter, I get the Bianca with shredded mozzarella and a salad (also made to order). Prices can't be beat!",Positive,Neutral

Nearly every single Saturday, I would be hungover from a night of drinking.  I would always order the same thing, the super size pho dac biet or just the large pho before the super size came in!  The broth is just so delicate and refreshing.  I usually add a buttload of the chili oil and the fresh chili to make my broth have an extra kick to wake me up.  The bean sprouts...I fu%^in pour that in as well as the jalapenos.  No basil cuz I hate it.  The meat is so delicious as well.  They do not skimp on the portions.  A double plus.  I never really had a bad service here before.  I mean, I don't expect a 5 star service.  It's a small restaurant and the owners are just trying to do their best.  The vietnamese lady owner knows my friend and I.  She would always make fun of us and stuff like that!  ""ALWAYS WITH THE TO GO BOX!""  LOL!  What?! It's so good and delicious I have to take some home for Sunday morning when I need to recover cuz you guys close Sundays!  I'll always have fond memories here at Noodle City!  When I visit Santa Barbara, I'll be sure to pay a visit to my favorite pho place.  Oh, and their Chow Fun isn't that bad either.  Its deeelicious!  :)",Neutral,Positive

From the food to the award winning service I can't praise this place more.  It was Mother's Day weekend so we waited for around 45 minutes but it's all worth it.  All seafood appetizers we ordered are fresh.  The waiter gave excellent service and checked on us maybe more than 5 times the whole time we were there.  He made sure that if we needed something he's just an eyeball away.  Grilled oysters are excellent (very fresh), fried calamari is bomb, crab cakes made me dream about it every night.  The ceviche is not bad either.  Overall I give this place 5 stars nothing less.",Positive,Positive

The ambiance is so relaxing and refreshing.
From the greeting staff to the servers, SMILES all around.
The food was so great. The hardest thing is choosing what to order because they have such an approachable menu with amazing options.
They have a full bar but the specialty drinks are fantastic, they definitely have the tropical vibe down.
So if you're out on a date night or just want fine dining with great service, this place is for you. 
You won't be disappointed.
