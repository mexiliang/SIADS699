### Introduction
We intend to study Yelp reviews through Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) to 
discover the aspects or dimensions and their sentiments in the review text. With respect to restaurant reviews, aspects mean dimensions like 'food quality', 'ambiance' etc.. The goal of our project is twofold: For customers searching for a specific restaurant we want to provide a list of top aspects along with their sentiment score for that restaurant. For business owners, we want to provide a comprehensive solution for improving aspects of reviews written for their restaurants, and this would be accomplished by finding similar restaurants which have high ratings for these aspects and providing most useful reviews associated with these aspects.
